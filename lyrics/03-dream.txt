come now through all of it, downtown and tenement
through dark clouds, all circling our house, like a tourniquet
the front door splinters in, you come down the hall unfaltering
your lips licked and shimmering, leaning in and i'm vanishing

i close my eyes
and you arrive

but oh it's just a dream, it's just a dream
but it's just a dream until you see it happening

in the plaza after work
i saw you rise up out of your collard shirts
on the horizon there was another world
we left the phantom hand and we ran for her

i close my eyes
and we're aligned
and that's a blinding light

but oh it's just a dream, it's just a dream, it's just a dream
but it's just a dream until you see it happening
and then it changes everything

couldn't we make, couldn't we make, couldn't we make it?
just like we wanted, just like we need it?
why can't we, just like a dream?

who says we can't, who says we can't, who says we shouldn't?
who says we couldn't make it just like we love it?
why can't we, just like a dream?

but oh it's just a dream
