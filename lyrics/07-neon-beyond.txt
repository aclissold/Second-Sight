baby in the basket
i saw you reaching our your hand
you were grasping at the wind
i knew exactly what you meant

i was sitting on the last train
it was dragging me home to all of that mess
and pulled over the tracks
sitting still felt more like falling back

and out come the hands
out comes the rug from underneath
and everything seems so real
til you're waking up here at the wheel

after all you've given up
every crumb they took from your tongue
after all your bitter luck
you're done, you're saying 'enough is enough'

i know it's a hard world
we're given to cling to the easier path
but this is a wrong turn
feeling that fear is the only way past

so do not be hemmed in
do not by dollar, not doctrine, nor snow, no
dont' think of small things
turn your eye to the neon beyond

no after all you've given up
every crumb they took from your tongue
after all your bitter luck
all your silently swallowing's done
after all you've given up
all your drowned and your runaway sons
now you ought to be speaking up
saying 'enough is enough' but is 'enough is enough' enough?

find the sapling
sand it smooth
sharpen the stone edge
feather the grooves
make it sure, make it true, before you let it loose

feel the moment
see the moves
calm and focused
as you notch the wood
you put everything in, then you let go of it
all that you did, just let go of it
yeah that's how it is, you let go of it

we were looking back
we were looking down
but we're looking up
we're looking out now!
look at us! looking up!
