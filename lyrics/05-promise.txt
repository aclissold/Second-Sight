ye lowlives
laughing too much
never close your eyes
til the sun's coming up
underslept, overdreamt

my whole life
trying to speak
but silent
with so much beneath it
that thick wind under the surface
you don't know me, or my purpose
or my promise, i got promise

your hands and feet
for all of their grief
turned out to be
only your elbows and knees
you go father, you're just starting to see

and you see that red pen
hover in judgement
and that census
get those numbers away from us
cause honest, we got nothing
in our pockets but thin wrists
and promise, we got promise

i'm waking up
pull me from my sheets in the dark
as if in a dream, lifting off
let me feel it shift in my blood
let my feel like i'm rising up
out of all the ashes and dust
out of all the past - that's done
i don't need what's long dead and gone, man, i got promise
i got promiseâ€¦
