take your hands
your mother's hands
and fold them in your dress

all the time i've known you've had them out
flashed about
and helping where you can

oh you give and give and give and give and it's
time to rest

now you need to breathe it in
i want you to receive
and go to sleep

i will watch over you
nothing will go wrong
i won't sit until you're strong

i've got lots to give
i've got all you've given to me

all you've given to me
breathe it in
mama go to sleep.
