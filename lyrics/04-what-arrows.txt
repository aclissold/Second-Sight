it curves in through the weather
it's coming from above
and it brought us together
it guided us to touch
and it moves in a rhythm yeah

what tender tailor came
and pushed a thread through each of us?
then he left us alone
to walk our length oblivious
but our feet fall in a rhythm yeah
it's there if you're listening

i can't believe it, i think i believe in this

what arrow? at what angle? and what angel?
did he wait until we met?
in that holy moment, oh, did he throw it?
to pin our broken bodies here?
to see us writhe in a rhythm yeah
it's there if you're listening

i can't believe it, i think i believe in this

we open the door and we're in the river
but we're not getting wet
rush hour comes and we go above their heads
we don't even fold our hands
open the door and we're in the forest
y'know we ain't getting scared
bring me the cliff, i'm going over it
let her just reel me in
