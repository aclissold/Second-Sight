and that's when the shadow came
and darkened your china face
the dancers still shook and swayed
but i couldn't look away

they were all in their chemicals
a hundred cars up an icy hill
and we were stood under them
grim and quietly grimacing

and you spoke with that voice i love
and love awoke in my boiling blood
where death sat a sec before
the road is lit and i'm going home

there'll be no caving in
no suicide note, no pills and gin
i'll hear your voice again
and it stirs me like a pealing bell
echoed by everything, everywhere
by every fraught fibre, and every cell
hear em telling you:

you're not the only one
feeling this stuff
you're one of us

and that's when the shadow lifts
and the camera reveals her lips
and all the lava under your skin
you gotta always remember it

and try not to talk at all
and say all of that common stuff
no just let the lava come
and all the love you've been holding off

yeah that's when we're rising up
feel the elevator pull your guts
each floor is like the medicine drops
the only fear is the fear it'll stop

but it won't because
no it never stops
cause it's in your blood
you're one of us

yeah that's when we're rising up
out of the ashes and plastic cups
arm in arm on a dirty rug
where they're all dancing to jungle love

i don't care if a shadow comes
and covers us like a shovel of rocks
the party's still going on
and i heard cathedral bells
