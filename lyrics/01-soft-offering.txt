the long knife of the sun rising
up the horizon and into our tired eyes

the spell of night is struck down
our second sight is bleeding out

anna, can i come and walk you home?
i'm not gonna wanna be alone
beaten up when the sunlight comes
bullied and cut by the clock on the wall

take the morning and the chlorinous light
you can have the afternoon, bury the evening too
give me the gathering calm of the night
when the day is done and rest is coming on

under the pitch and the pull of the moon
sweet silver medicine swim in my temples and
bring in the shadows to cover our flaws
when the pain is gone and the rest is coming on

you belong out of that uniform
out in the streets when everyone else is asleep

see the way the body sways
in empty air when there's nobody there
and you don't even care if there is

anna can i be to you like that?
cover your shame with a shield of black
cover your body with my trembling hands
have you dancing while i hold them back

hold back the morning and her chlorinous light
have at the afternoon, bury the evening too
let's have the gathering calm of the night
when the day is done and the rest is coming on

under the pitch and the pull of the moon
sweet silver medicine swim in my temples and
bring in the shadows to cover our wounds
when the pain is gone and the rest is coming on
