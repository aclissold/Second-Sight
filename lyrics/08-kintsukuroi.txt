bring that summer on your shoulders
bring that summer when i first saw you
and that first kiss coming, lets just freeze the frame
your blue eyes closing as mine were opening

on into the gold river
oh, but i was alone come winter

oh stand in front of me
open your eyes like you know me

oh like you can see inside of me
lay your healer's hands upon me
and bring that summer sun

see us stood akimbo, ever cavalier and cold
raise on pixels - in they come, in they come, in they pour like poison
all their lies and fantasy
but i want your faults aley, i want the real thing!

on into the gold the river
oh, where the rocks'll wreck you
oh, but then the rocks'll save you
the hands will help you up

oh stand in front of me
open your eyes like you know me

oh see inside of me
lay the heels of your hands upon me
and let your fingers fall

bless the broken bowl
make it whole, make it better than it was before
make it better than it was before!

oh stand in front of me
painted gold, coming on home
and bring that summer sun
